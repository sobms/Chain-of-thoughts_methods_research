Q: Tobias is buying a new pair of shoes that costs $95. He has been saving up his money each month for the past three months. He gets a $5 allowance a month. He also mows lawns and shovels driveways. He charges $15 to mow a lawn and $7 to shovel. After buying the shoes, he has $15 in change. If he mows 4 lawns, how many driveways did he shovel? 
A: How much money did Tobias save up? ** He saved up $110 total because 95 + 15 = 110.
How much money did Tobias save from his allowance? ** He saved $15 from his allowance because 3 x 5 = 15.
How much money did Tobias earn mowing lawns? ** He earned $60 mowing lawns because 4 x 15 = 60.
How much money did Tobias earn shoveling driveways? ** He earned $35 shoveling driveways because 110 - 60 - 15 = 35.
How many driveways did Tobias shovel? ** He shoveled 5 driveways because 35 / 7 = 5.

Q: For every 1 minute that Carlotta sings on stage during the final opera performance, she spends an additional 3 minutes practicing and 5 minutes throwing temper tantrums. If her final stage performance is 6 minutes long, what is the total combined amount of time, in minutes, that she spends practicing, throwing tantrums, and singing in the final stage performance?
A: How many minutes does Carlotta spend practicing? ** For each 6 minutes she performs, Carlotta spends 6 * 3 minutes = 18 minutes practicing.
How many minutes does Carlotta spend throwing tantrums? ** For each 6 minutes she performs, Carlotta throws tantrums for 6 * 5 minutes = 30 minutes.
How many minutes does Carlotta spend on all three activities? ** Thus, in total, for each 6 minutes of performance time, she spends 18 minutes + 30 minutes + 6 minutes = 54 minutes on all three activities.

A: How many oranges are there? ** We start by finding out that since there are twice as many oranges as the 5 bananas, this means there are 5*2=10 oranges.
How many apples are there? ** Since there are twice as many apples as the 10 oranges, this means there 10*2=20 apples.
How many fruits are there in total? ** In total, this means there are 20+10+5= 35 fruits on the display.
The answer is 35.
Q: Uncle Bradley has a $1000 bill that he wants to change into smaller bills so he could give them to his nieces and nephews. He wants to change 3/10 of the money into $50 bills while the rest into $100 bills. How many pieces of bills will Uncle Bradley have in all?
A: How much money will be changed into $50 bills? ** There will be $1000 x 3/10 = $300 worth of money that will be changed into $50 bills.
How many pieces of $50 bills will Uncle Bradley have? ** Uncle Bradley will have $300/$50 = 6 pieces of $50 bills.
How much money will be changed into $100 bills? ** He will change $1000 - $300 = $700 worth of money into $100 bills.
How many pieces of $100 bills will Uncle Bradley have? ** So there will be $700/$100 = 7 pieces of $100 bills.
How many pieces of bills will Uncle Bradley have in all? ** Thus, there will be a total of 6 + 7 = 13 pieces of $50 and $100 bills in all.
